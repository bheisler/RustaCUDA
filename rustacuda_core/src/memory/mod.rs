/// Marker trait for types which can safely be copied to or from a CUDA device.
///
/// A type can be safely copied if its value can be duplicated simply by copying bits and if it does
/// not contain a reference to memory which is not accessible to the device. Additionally, the
/// DeviceCopy trait does not imply copy semantics as the Copy trait does.
///
/// ## How can I implement DeviceCopy?
///
/// There are two ways to implement DeviceCopy on your type. The simplest is to use `derive`:
///
/// ```
/// #[macro_use]
/// extern crate rustacuda;
///
/// #[derive(Clone, DeviceCopy)]
/// struct MyStruct(u64);
///
/// # fn main () {}
/// ```
///
/// This is safe because the `DeviceCopy` derive macro will check that all fields of the struct,
/// enum or union implement `DeviceCopy`. For example, this fails to compile, because `Vec` cannot
/// be copied to the device:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// # #[macro_use]
/// # extern crate rustacuda;
/// #[derive(Clone, DeviceCopy)]
/// struct MyStruct(Vec<u64>);
/// # fn main () {}
/// ```
///
/// You can also implement `DeviceCopy` unsafely:
///
/// ```
/// use rustacuda::memory::DeviceCopy;
///
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct MyStruct(u64);
///
/// unsafe impl DeviceCopy for MyStruct { }
/// # fn main () {}
/// ```
///
/// ## What is the difference between `DeviceCopy` and `Copy`?
///
/// `DeviceCopy` is stricter than `Copy`. `DeviceCopy` must only be implemented for types which
/// do not contain references or raw pointers to non-device-accessible memory. `DeviceCopy` also
/// does not imply copy semantics - that is, `DeviceCopy` values are not implicitly copied on
/// assignment the way that `Copy` values are. This is helpful, as it may be desirable to implement
/// `DeviceCopy` for large structures that would be inefficient to copy for every assignment.
///
/// ## When can't my type be `DeviceCopy`?
///
/// Some types cannot be safely copied to the device. For example, copying `&T` would create an
/// invalid reference on the device which would segfault if dereferenced. Generalizing this, any
/// type implementing `Drop` cannot be `DeviceCopy` since it is responsible for some resource that
/// would not be available on the device.
